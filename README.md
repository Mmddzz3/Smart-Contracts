# Smart-Contracts
- **To get started with Smart Contracts I created a basic Smart Contract Bider which I have coded in Solidity Language and run the same on Remix IDE**
- Following functions are implemented in Bider.sol :
   - [x] **setName** which sets the name of the bider.
   - [x] **setBidAmount** which sets the bidAmount from the bider.
   - [x] **determineEligibility** which determines the eligibility of the bider to perform the biding.
